/*
 Zero-indexed array A of N integers. Rotation means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is also moved to the first place.
 
 
 Write a function:
 given array A of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times
 
 
 For example, given array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] and K = 3, the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8].
 
 Assume:
 
 N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
 each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
